# stratified-and-cluster-sampling

The purpose of the study was to understand the mean percentage of subsidized meals in California schools using the Academic Index for California Schools data set. I developed R codes to do 10,000 sample simulations using three sampling methods: simple random sampling, proportional stratified sampling and one stage cluster sampling. I found similar mean percentages of subsidized meals for the 3 different sampling methods. However, the standard error was wider in one stage cluster sampling because the dataset is biased towards elementary schools.
